   ```

3. **For Python Code (3rd snippet):**
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - statsmodels

   You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy statsmodels
   ```

### For R Code:
1. **For R Code (1st snippet):**
   - base R (no additional package needed for the provided example)

2. **For R Code (2nd snippet):**
   - base R
   - statsmodels package

   You can install `statsmodels` in R using:
